1. Create Missing Domain Models (Domain Responsibility)
   - Create Domain/Models/ModerationResult.cs (domain model, not infrastructure)
   - Create Domain/Models/FollowResult.cs (domain model, not infrastructure)
   
2. Implement Rich Domain Entities (Domain Responsibility)
   - Add business methods to User entity (ChangePassword validation, business rules)
   - Add business methods to Post entity (AddHashtag, ValidateContent business rules)
   - Add business methods to Profile entity (Follow validation, business rules)
   - Entities should contain business logic, not just data

3. Complete Domain Event Definitions (Domain Responsibility)
   - Add missing domain events: UserPasswordChangedEvent, PostLikedEvent, etc.
   - Ensure entities raise events in business methods
   - Events represent things that happened in the business domain

4. Fix Anemic Domain Model
   - Move business validation from services into entities/value objects
   - Add domain methods that enforce business invariants
   - Ensure aggregates protect their consistency boundaries
