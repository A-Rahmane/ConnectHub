1. Complete Rich Domain Entity Business Methods (Domain Responsibility)
   - Add business methods to Comment entity:
     * Comment.Create() factory method with validation and domain events
     * Comment.UpdateContent() with business rules
     * Comment.CanBeEditedBy() authorization logic
   
   - Add state transition methods to Follow entity:
     * Follow.Accept() - change status to Active, raise domain event
     * Follow.Reject() - change status to Rejected, raise domain event  
     * Follow.Block() - change status to Blocked, raise domain event
   
   - Enhance Like entity with factory methods:
     * Like.CreatePostLike() with validation
     * Like.CreateCommentLike() with validation
     * Add business rule validation (prevent duplicate likes)

2. Add Missing Domain Events for New Business Methods
   - CommentCreatedEvent (should be raised in Comment.Create())
   - FollowAcceptedEvent, FollowRejectedEvent, FollowBlockedEvent
   - Ensure all new business methods raise appropriate domain events
